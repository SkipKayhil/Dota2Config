Skipped's Dota 2 Config
=======================

This is the config file I use to play Dota 2. It remaps basic abilities to quickcast along with adding tons of useful binds in places that are easy to reach.

Main Layout (without my modifications): credit to Loopuleasa and his [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2gd3gc/the_config_guy_here_once_again_bringing_the_v32/)

How to use
----------
You can download the zipped file on the right. 

####Extract the Config file to:
`$steam$/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg` 
(where $steam$ is your Steam installation folder)

See the images below as there are lots of binds!
