Skipped's Dota 2 Config
=======================

This is the config file I use to play Dota 2. It includes some simple things like disabling zoom, and also some complex things like rune hotkeys and two chat wheels.

How to use
----------
You can download the zipped file on the right. 

###Extract the Config file to:
`$steam$/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta\dota\cfg` 
(where $steam$ is your Steam installation folder)


Launch Options
--------------
I have also included my launch options in the config in the event you want to use them.

###Copy the launch options to:
1. Right click on Dota 2 in Steam Library
2. Select "Properties"
3. Select "Set Launch Options"
4. Paste into the box, then add your monitors dimensions where it says to put them (you'll know, it's at the end)

Tada! Hope you enjoy!
